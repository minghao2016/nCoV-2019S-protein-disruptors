***Please note that binder server setup on the cloud will take < 3 minutes at most. You will first see a Binder page with some log messages. After the setup, you will see an instance of Jupyer notebook in your browser. Click the Jupyter notebook, ML-COVID-disruptors.ipynb, to begin the tutorial***.

**Please note that I was not able to make Binder work with Safari on Mac OS, instead use Chrome browser. If you are on Windows, please also use Chrome.**
